## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Implement TimesFM for Agriculture**

### Step 1: Data Preparation
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Example: Crop yield data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': pd.date_range('2020-01-01', periods=1000, freq='D'),
    'yield': your_yield_data,  # Your actual data
    'temperature': weather_data,
    'rainfall': rainfall_data
})
```

### Step 2: Model Setup
```python
import timesfm

# Initialize TimesFM
tfm = timesfm.TimesFm(
    hparams=timesfm.TimesFmHparams(
        backend="cpu",
        per_core_batch_size=1,
        horizon_len=30,  # Forecast 30 days ahead
        context_len=512,
        num_layers=20,
        use_positional_embedding=False,
    ),
    checkpoint=timesfm.TimesFmCheckpoint(
        huggingface_repo_id="google/timesfm-1.0-200m-pytorch"
    )
)
```

### Step 3: Forecasting
```python
# Prepare your data
yield_data = data['yield'].values.astype(np.float32)

# Make forecast
point_forecast, quantile_forecast = tfm.forecast(
    [yield_data],
    freq=[0]  # Daily frequency
)

# Get uncertainty estimates
forecast_mean = point_forecast[0]
forecast_uncertainty = quantile_forecast[0]
```

## üìà **Real-World Agricultural Examples**

### Example 1: Wheat Yield Forecasting
```python
# Historical wheat yield data (tons/hectare)
wheat_yields = [3.2, 3.5, 3.1, 3.8, 3.6, 3.9, 4.1, 3.7, 4.0, 3.4]  # Your data

# Forecast next season's yield
forecast = tfm.forecast([wheat_yields], freq=[2])  # Annual frequency
print(f"Predicted wheat yield: {forecast[0][0]:.1f} tons/hectare")
```

### Example 2: Daily Milk Production
```python
# Daily milk production (liters)
milk_production = [450, 460, 455, 470, 465, 480, 475, 490, 485, 500]  # Your data

# Forecast next 30 days
forecast = tfm.forecast([milk_production], freq=[0])  # Daily frequency
print(f"Average predicted production: {np.mean(forecast[0]):.1f} liters/day")
```

### Example 3: Soil Moisture Prediction
```python
# Soil moisture percentage
soil_moisture = [45, 42, 38, 35, 40, 43, 47, 50, 48, 45]  # Your data

# Forecast next week
forecast = tfm.forecast([soil_moisture], freq=[0])  # Daily frequency
print(f"Predicted soil moisture: {forecast[0][0]:.1f}%")
```
