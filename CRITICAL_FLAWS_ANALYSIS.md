- **User Impact**: Difficult to use in field conditions
- **Fix Needed**: Complete mobile-first redesign

### **3. OVERWHELMING DATA PRESENTATION**
**Problem**: Information overload without visual aids
- **Current**: Dense text, basic charts, no data storytelling
- **Issue**: Farmers can't quickly interpret complex data
- **User Impact**: Decision paralysis, missed insights
- **Fix Needed**: Visual storytelling, simplified data presentation

### **4. LIMITED ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES**
**Problem**: Not accessible to users with disabilities
- **Current**: No screen reader support, no text scaling
- **Issue**: Excludes users with visual impairments
